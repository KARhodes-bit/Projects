üñ•Ô∏è About
This repository contains a collection of projects coded in C# from my CSE1321L class at Kennesaw State University. These assignments were designed to build a strong foundation in programming and problem-solving, focusing on:

Developing algorithms
Implementing efficient code solutions
Understanding core programming principles
Control Structures: Conditional statements, loops, and decision-making
Functions and Methods: Writing reusable and modular code
Arrays and Collections: Managing data effectively
Basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes, objects, and encapsulation
Debugging and Error Handling: Identifying and resolving code issues
Number Guessing Game

A simple console game that uses loops and conditionals to guess a randomly generated number.
Grade Calculator

An application that calculates the average of grades and determines the final letter grade.
Shopping Cart Simulation

A program that simulates adding and removing items from a cart and calculates the total price.
Basic Geometry Calculator

A tool to calculate the area and perimeter of basic shapes like circles, rectangles, and triangles.

üí° These projects showcase my growth in programming and problem-solving skills, as well as my ability to write clean, functional code. They reflect my journey toward mastering the fundamentals of computer science and preparing for advanced courses in my degree program.

Feel free to explore and leave feedback!
